# Bike_Sharing_Assignment_Linear_Regression
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## General Information
- You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- Season column gives a handful insight says that “Fall” and “Summer” season seen a greater booking as compared another season.
- During the summer period i.e., June, July recorded a greater number of Bike counts.
- Weather seems to also have a impact on bike rental we can infer on the bar plot.
- Significant increase in rentals YOY.
- Holiday seems to be downside as no one interests in bikes as they can opt for a family trip, which can’t be accommodated on Bike.
- R Square tend to be better on OLS model with 0.84 as the score.
- Tend to drop if we use cross validation @ 0.82
